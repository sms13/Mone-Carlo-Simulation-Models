# Mone-Carlo-Simulation-Models

This repo has a few examples of MC simulation in R, with a focus on interactive simulations in Shiny.

Newsvendor_app.R is a Shiny app that allows user to change Newsvendor model parameters and view simulation results under those changes.

Newsvendor.R is a is a "de-Shiny'd" version of Newsvendor_app.R.  It is intended to provide a simple intro (e.g., a "first model") to Monte Carlo simulation in R, and does not try to be interactive (e.g., it's a "normal" R script).

MC_Simulation_Examples_app.R is a Shiny app that includes the Newvendor on one tab, and has a Project Management simulation example on another tab.
Future examples can be added as tabs to this model.
